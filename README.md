First we will explore the language of HTML such as you may know as HyperText Markup Language.

To write an HTML file we will discover that it is very and simply easy to use what we called, taggs.

The taggs are distinguished by two to three special characters.

We defined opening tagg by opening tagg and clossing tagg.
